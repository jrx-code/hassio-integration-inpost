"""Constants for the Shipment Tracking (Śledzenie przesyłek) integration.

Multi-carrier: InPost (lockers, QR, multiskrytka) and DPD (to-address, status
history). Each config entry carries a ``carrier`` discriminator; entries created
before multi-carrier support default to InPost.

v2.0.0 (2026-08-25): version bumped from 1.x to signal a real scope change, not
an incremental fix — this stopped being "InPost with a DPD side-quest" the day
the InPost carrier module was brought to parity with prod (app-to-app sharing,
button/switch entities, carrier-prefixed identifiers so DPD/InPost never
collide under the shared domain). Framework target: InPost + DPD today, DHL +
GLS + Pocztex planned (zero existing protocol research for any of the three —
each needs its own reverse-engineering spike, same as DPD got 2026-08-06).

**Cutover to prod done 2026-08-25** (same day as the parity merge — Faza 4 of
the rework plan, no SMS re-onboarding needed): the three ``inpost``-domain
config entries (Jarek/Marian/Betacom) carried a non-rotating refresh_token, so
new ``shipment_tracking`` entries were created directly in
``core.config_entries`` reusing those tokens, verified live, then the old
``inpost`` entries were deleted and the 42 resulting entities (which had
landed on ``_2``/collision-suffixed entity_ids next to the still-live old
ones) were renamed back to their original entity_id via
``config/entity_registry/update`` over the WS API — so cards/automations
built against ``sensor.inpost_<alias>_*`` kept working unchanged. The old
``custom_components/inpost`` (v0.8.0) files are still on disk on prod
(orphaned, no config entry references them) — not yet cleaned up.

Gotcha hit during cutover: a first restart with 6 InPost-family config
entries loading at once took several minutes (still investigating whether
``_async_reload_peers_missing_us``'s peer-reload cascade was the cause) —
long enough that it looked hung from the outside. Do not assume a slow InPost
restart is stuck; check the container's own log timestamps for real silence
before intervening.
