"""Constants for the Shipment Tracking (Śledzenie przesyłek) integration.

Multi-carrier: InPost (lockers, QR, multiskrytka), DPD (to-address, status
history), FedEx (official REST API, track-by-number) and Pocztex (Keycloak
OAuth2, account auto-discovery). Each config entry carries a ``carrier``
discriminator; entries created before multi-carrier support default to
InPost.

v2.4.0 (2026-08-25): Pocztex's carrier module replaced — the first cut
(same-day v2.3.0) used Poczta Polska's official track-by-number SOAP service
because Pocztex Mobile's own app needs email/password + ToS registration
(heavier than InPost/DPD's SMS flow) to unlock its phone-based
auto-discovery. Then it turned out that gate is only for *creating* an
account — an *existing* one logs in fine over plain HTTP (Keycloak
authorization_code+PKCE, no browser needed), and its
/api/customer/tracking endpoint gives real account auto-discovery, same
shape as DPD/InPost. That's strictly better than track-by-number, so it
replaced it rather than living alongside it. GLS is the only
originally-planned carrier still untouched.

v2.2.0 (2026-08-25): FedEx added — architecturally the odd one out. InPost/DPD
are reverse-engineered consumer apps (phone+SMS, auto-discover "my parcels").
FedEx is developer.fedex.com's documented Track API (OAuth2 client_credentials,
one Client ID/Secret per FedEx developer org project) with no account-level
auto-discovery at all — recipients aren't tied to a phone number the way
InPost/DPD's consumer apps work, so the config entry holds a manually-maintained
tracking-number list (options, not auth data) instead. DHL Parcel Polska and
Allegro One were also scouted the same day: DHL got a full spike (see
HANDOVER-20260825-dhl-parcel-api-research.md) but hit a 24h account lockout
before a working handshake; Allegro turned out track-by-number only, same
shape as FedEx, deferred (no test waybill on hand). GLS + Pocztex still
untouched.

v2.0.0 (2026-08-25): version bumped from 1.x to signal a real scope change, not
an incremental fix — this stopped being "InPost with a DPD side-quest" the day
the InPost carrier module was brought to parity with prod (app-to-app sharing,
button/switch entities, carrier-prefixed identifiers so DPD/InPost never
collide under the shared domain). Framework target: InPost + DPD today, DHL +
GLS + Pocztex planned (zero existing protocol research for any of the three —
each needs its own reverse-engineering spike, same as DPD got 2026-08-06).

**Cutover to prod done 2026-08-25** (same day as the parity merge — Faza 4 of
the rework plan, no SMS re-onboarding needed): the three ``inpost``-domain
config entries (Jarek/Marian/Betacom) carried a non-rotating refresh_token, so
new ``shipment_tracking`` entries were created directly in
``core.config_entries`` reusing those tokens, verified live, then the old
``inpost`` entries were deleted and the 42 resulting entities (which had
landed on ``_2``/collision-suffixed entity_ids next to the still-live old
ones) were renamed back to their original entity_id via
``config/entity_registry/update`` over the WS API — so cards/automations
built against ``sensor.inpost_<alias>_*`` kept working unchanged. The old
``custom_components/inpost`` (v0.8.0) files are still on disk on prod
(orphaned, no config entry references them) — not yet cleaned up.

Gotcha hit during cutover: a first restart with 6 InPost-family config
entries loading at once took several minutes (still investigating whether
``_async_reload_peers_missing_us``'s peer-reload cascade was the cause) —
long enough that it looked hung from the outside. Do not assume a slow InPost
restart is stuck; check the container's own log timestamps for real silence
before intervening.

# track-by-number implementation (Poczta Polska's official tt.poczta-polska.pl
# tracking web service) once this proved auto-discovery — like DPD/InPost —
# actually works and isn't gated behind self-service signup (registration is
# app-only, but an existing account logs in fine over plain HTTP with no
# browser). Reimplemented from the observed protocol; no code copied.
#
# Verified live 2026-08-25 against a real account: full login (email+password
# -> PKCE code -> token exchange, zero browser involved), GET .../tracking
# with a real Bearer token returning real parcels (2 delivered, numbers
# PX-prefixed — matches third-party docs on Pocztex's number format).
# direct password grant is explicitly disabled for this client
# ("Client not allowed for direct access grants") and offline_access scope
# is rejected ("Invalid scopes") — both confirmed by the server's own error,
# not assumed — hence the full PKCE dance instead of a one-shot password
# grant, and the "refresh often enough to never let the session idle out"
