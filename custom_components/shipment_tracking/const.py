"""Constants for the Shipment Tracking (Śledzenie przesyłek) integration.

Multi-carrier: InPost (lockers, QR, multiskrytka), DPD (to-address, status
history), FedEx (official REST API, track-by-number) and Pocztex (official
SOAP API, track-by-number). Each config entry carries a ``carrier``
discriminator; entries created before multi-carrier support default to
InPost.

v2.3.0 (2026-08-25): Pocztex added, same session as FedEx. Poczta Polska's
own "Pocztex Mobile" app needs email/password + ToS registration (heavier
than InPost/DPD's SMS flow) for its phone-based auto-discovery, so — like
FedEx — this uses the official track-by-number SOAP web service instead
(WS-Security with a fixed public credential, not per-account). GLS is the
only originally-planned carrier still untouched.

v2.2.0 (2026-08-25): FedEx added — architecturally the odd one out. InPost/DPD
are reverse-engineered consumer apps (phone+SMS, auto-discover "my parcels").
FedEx is developer.fedex.com's documented Track API (OAuth2 client_credentials,
one Client ID/Secret per FedEx developer org project) with no account-level
auto-discovery at all — recipients aren't tied to a phone number the way
InPost/DPD's consumer apps work, so the config entry holds a manually-maintained
tracking-number list (options, not auth data) instead. DHL Parcel Polska and
Allegro One were also scouted the same day: DHL got a full spike (see
HANDOVER-20260825-dhl-parcel-api-research.md) but hit a 24h account lockout
before a working handshake; Allegro turned out track-by-number only, same
shape as FedEx, deferred (no test waybill on hand). GLS + Pocztex still
untouched.

v2.0.0 (2026-08-25): version bumped from 1.x to signal a real scope change, not
an incremental fix — this stopped being "InPost with a DPD side-quest" the day
the InPost carrier module was brought to parity with prod (app-to-app sharing,
button/switch entities, carrier-prefixed identifiers so DPD/InPost never
collide under the shared domain). Framework target: InPost + DPD today, DHL +
GLS + Pocztex planned (zero existing protocol research for any of the three —
each needs its own reverse-engineering spike, same as DPD got 2026-08-06).

**Cutover to prod done 2026-08-25** (same day as the parity merge — Faza 4 of
the rework plan, no SMS re-onboarding needed): the three ``inpost``-domain
config entries (Jarek/Marian/Betacom) carried a non-rotating refresh_token, so
new ``shipment_tracking`` entries were created directly in
``core.config_entries`` reusing those tokens, verified live, then the old
``inpost`` entries were deleted and the 42 resulting entities (which had
landed on ``_2``/collision-suffixed entity_ids next to the still-live old
ones) were renamed back to their original entity_id via
``config/entity_registry/update`` over the WS API — so cards/automations
built against ``sensor.inpost_<alias>_*`` kept working unchanged. The old
``custom_components/inpost`` (v0.8.0) files are still on disk on prod
(orphaned, no config entry references them) — not yet cleaned up.

Gotcha hit during cutover: a first restart with 6 InPost-family config
entries loading at once took several minutes (still investigating whether
``_async_reload_peers_missing_us``'s peer-reload cascade was the cause) —
long enough that it looked hung from the outside. Do not assume a slow InPost
restart is stuck; check the container's own log timestamps for real silence
before intervening.

# feature, a much heavier gate than InPost/DPD's SMS flow, so this carrier
# skips it — same tradeoff as FedEx). Auth is WS-Security UsernameToken with
# a fixed, publicly documented pair (username "sledzeniepp", password "PPSA")
# used by third-party integrators for years — not a per-account secret, so
# it's a plain constant here rather than something fetched from config.
#
# Verified live 2026-08-25: WS-Security auth accepted, the exact request/
# response XML shape (namespace-qualified <numer> under the sprawdzPrzesylkePl
# element), and the "not found" response (status=-1, danePrzesylki nil) for
# both a UPU-format test number (RR123456785PL) and a Pocztex-style 20-digit
# numeric one (per third-party docs: Pocztex parcel numbers are 20 digits
# starting with "00" — NOT verified against this service with a real
# Pocztex waybill, only structurally accepted). The batch operation
# (sprawdzPrzesylkiPl) returned only 1 result for 2 submitted numbers in two
# separate tests — unexplained, not used here; per-number calls only.
# Real found-parcel response shape (a non-nil danePrzesylki) not yet seen.
