"""DataUpdateCoordinator for the DHL carrier.

The config entry holds a snapshot of the cookiejar (CONF_COOKIES) plus a
stable device_id/device_name pair. The coordinator restores those cookies
into its own DhlApi instance at setup and calls refresh_session() every
poll — verified live to mint a fresh-``iat`` token from cookies alone, a
real sliding 30-minute window (unlike Pocztex's, see const.py's DHL
section).

CORRECTED 2026-08-28, on Jarek's and Marian's live accounts. The earlier
version deliberately did NOT write the jar back to entry.data, on the
theory that the login-time snapshot would still be good after a restart.
It is not, and the first real restart proved it: both DHL entries came up
``setup_error`` / "DHL session expired". Autopsy of the stored snapshot —
cookies ``BIGipServer…``, ``TS…``, ``access-token``, ``access-signature``,
``access-remember`` — showed the stored ``access-token`` was a JWT whose
``exp`` sat at login + 30 min, i.e. ~30 hours in the past, and replaying
that whole set against /auth/refresh returned 401. Dropping the expired
``access-token`` and replaying the rest (``access-remember`` included)
returned 401 as well, so ``access-remember`` alone does not carry an aged
session either.

CORRECTED AGAIN the same evening, before the claim could harden into
folklore: the first draft of this comment said the login-time jar is "spent
the moment the first refresh succeeds". That is NOT established. After a
fresh SMS reauth at 18:54 the entries survived a 19:05 HA restart on a jar
that was still the login-time one, ~11 minutes old. An hours-old jar dies,
a minutes-old one survives; where the boundary sits, and whether the cause
is rotation or plain ageing, is UNMEASURED. The fix is the same either way
and that is what matters: keep the STORED jar fresh, so a restart restores
one that is minutes old rather than hours.

So the jar is now persisted back to entry.data whenever it changes, which
in practice is every poll. That write is only safe because
_async_reload_on_update (__init__.py) reloads on options changes only —
without that guard this would reload the integration every poll, the same
storm DPD and Pocztex each hit once.

RESIDUAL, known and accepted: the first refresh of a setup runs while the
entry is still SETUP_IN_PROGRESS, and persisting from there is what left
DPD's coordinator empty until a reload (see coordinator_dpd.py). So that
one jar is not written, and a restart inside the first poll interval after
a reauth can still land on a spent snapshot and ask for SMS again. Every
later restart is covered.
